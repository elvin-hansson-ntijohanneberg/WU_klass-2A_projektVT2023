            <article id="iarticle_1" ><p>Machinarium is an indie puzzle-adventure game developed by Amanita Design. The game takes place in a whimsical, steampunk-inspired world populated by robots and machines. The player controls a small, rusty robot named Josef, who sets out on a quest.

                The game features hand-drawn graphics and a soundtrack composed by Tomas Dvorak. The puzzles in the game require the player to use logic and creativity to solve, and there is no dialogue or text in the game, with the story told through visuals and animations.
                <br>
                <br>
                Machinarium received critical acclaim for its charming visuals, engaging puzzles, and immersive atmosphere. It won several awards, including the Excellence in Visual Art award at the 2010 Independent Games Festival, and has been praised for its unique and innovative approach to storytelling and puzzle-solving in the indie game genre.</p></article>

                <article id="iarticle_2"><p>Machinarium follows the story of Josef, a small robot who is separated from his girlfriend, Berta and embarks on a journey to rescue her from the Black Cap Brotherhood, a gang of criminal robots.

                    <br>
                    The game starts with Josef being thrown into a garbage dump outside the city. He must navigate through the dump and find a way back into the city, which is controlled by the Black Cap Brotherhood. Along the way, he meets other robots who help him and give him hints on how to progress.

                    <br>
                    Once he makes it into the city, Josef must overcome various obstacles and solve puzzles to find his way to the Black Cap Brotherhood's hideout. He explores different areas of the city, including a bar, a train station, and a factory, each with their own unique challenges.

                    As he progresses, Josef learns more about the Black Cap Brotherhood's plan to blow up the city's tower, and realizes that his girlfriend is being held captive in their hideout. He must sneak past their guards, solve more puzzles, and ultimately defeat their leader in a final showdown to rescue his girlfriend and save the city.</p></article>
